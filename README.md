# Primitive Types Visualizer

A simple tool that simultaneously shows the decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary representations of a value for every integer data type (signed and unsigned; 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit).
Each of these representations are text boxes that can be edited, and all other text boxes are adjusted accordingly.
